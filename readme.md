## 🎯 Why I Created This Platform

I built this marketplace to:

- Provide users with easy access to high-quality JSON-based themes

- Ensure all content remains appropriate for all audiences

## ✅ Approval Process

Every theme (JSON configuration) undergoes review before publication to ensure:

- Content is appropriate for all audiences
- JSON structure follows our schema guidelines
- No NSFW or inappropriate material references
- All color schemes and styling are properly defined

## 🚫 Content Guidelines

We maintain a family-friendly platform where all theme JSON files must define:

- Appropriate styling for users of all ages
- No offensive or harmful content references
- Complete and valid JSON structure
- Proper metadata and documentation
